It enables smart actions on connected devices when prices are particularly low or high, simplifying the process of optimizing energy usage.</p> <p>By handling the complexities of API integration, validation, and near-optimal usage, the SDK eliminates much of the usual hassle. You simply define your desired actions, configure your preferences, and let the SDK handle the rest.</p> <p>For convenience, we recommend running the SDK on a Raspberry Pi, as it typically comes pre-installed with Python. This allows you to quickly install the SDK and start automating your energy-related actions.</p> <p>Recognizing that users may have diverse configuration needs, the SDK is designed to be highly customizable. You can define how prices are selected, specify how pricing data is used, and integrate the SDK with any actions or devices you choose\u2014all while maintaining flexibility and control.</p>"},{"location":"#current-supported-supplier-tariffs","title":"Current supported supplier tariffs","text":"<ul> <li>Octopus Agile Tariff</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#prospective-supplier-tariffs","title":"Prospective supplier tariffs","text":"<ul> <li>Octopus Go (EV Tariff)</li> <li>Octopus Tracker</li> <li>E.ON Next Agile</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#example-usage","title":"Example usage","text":"<p>If you want to be featured on here send me a message on linkedin and I'll get it listed here :)</p> <ul> <li>battery.craigwh.it: Raspberry Pi4b using smart scheduling to do battery arbitrage to keep a server online</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/custom-prices-to-include/","title":"Using custom price_to_include functions","text":"<p>As touched on in running first schedule page, this introduces the <code>number_to_include</code> configuration parameter, mentioning that it can either be a positive integer value or a custom function, this is going to show you how to use this method to select prices programattically.</p> <p>The function must always return an integer otherwise it will fail, this integer is the number of prices the pricing strategy will act on.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/custom-prices-to-include/#example","title":"Example","text":"<pre><code># main.py\nfrom domestic_tariff_scheduler_sdk import tariff, Price\n\ndef action_when_cheap(price: Price):\n    print(\"cheap\", price.value)\n\ndef action_when_expensive(price: Price)\n    print(\"expensive\", price.value)\n\ndef prices_to_include(prices: list[Price]):\n    # only get the count where sum cost is no greater than 15p/kWh\n    # i.e 3.0 + 5.0 + 3.0 + 4.0 = 15 (wont include 8.0)\n\n    total = 0\n    count = 0\n    sorted_prices = sorted(prices, key=lambda obj: min(obj.value, obj.value))\n    for price in sorted_prices:\n        total += price.value\n        count += 1\n        if total &gt;= 15:\n            break \n\n    return count\n\n\ntariff.run_octopus_agile_tariff_schedule(\n        prices_to_include: prices_to_include,\n        action_when_cheap: action_when_cheap,\n        action_when_expensive: action_when_expensive,\n)\n</code></pre> <p>In this setup I've created a theoretical scenario where I only want to spend take advantage of 15p/kWh total of prices, and work out from the available prices how many prices that is, which the strategy will then use.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/custom-pricing-strategies/","title":"Using custom pricing strategies","text":"<p>By default the scheduler will simply just rank the prices and assign them to the appropriate actions, but you might hit a case where you need something more complex than that, such as if you have a system where constraints are important or if you wanted to introduce another parameter to the scheduling, such as carbon intensity.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/custom-pricing-strategies/#what-are-these","title":"What are these?","text":"<p>Custom pricing strategies are python classes that you define and pass into the method for the appropriate tariff, in these you can write your own functionality that acts on the prices, this is using a Strategy pattern which injects in the config in runtime so that you can use the values you addtionally passed in.</p> <p>For a description of the configuration you can pass in see configuration.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/custom-pricing-strategies/#example-creating-a-custom-pricing-strategy","title":"Example: creating a custom pricing strategy","text":"<p>Here I'm going to set up a custom pricing strategy which makes sure:</p> <ul> <li>I don't ever spend more than 10p/kWh</li> <li>I only ever switch on my device if carbon intensity is below 100 units</li> </ul> <p>Additionally I'm going to set up some custom actions which:</p> <ul> <li>Send a text message to my phone telling me that my smart plug is being switched on (done via AWS SNS)</li> <li>Send a HTTP RPC request to my shelly on the same WIFI network to start and stop when this conditions are met</li> </ul> <pre><code>from domestic_tariff_scheduler_sdk import tariff, Price, PricingStrategy, ScheduleConfig\n\nclass CustomPricingStrategy(PricingStrategy):\n    def __init__(self, config: ScheduleConfig):\n        self.config = config # for access to other set configuration\n\n    def _get_carbon_intensity(self, price: Price):\n        res = requests.get(f\"https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/intensity/{price.datetime_from}\")\n        return res.json()[\"data\"][0][\"intensity\"][\"actual\"]\n\n    def handle_price(self, price: Price, prices: list[Price]):\n        if price.value &lt;
